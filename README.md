This is the client-side of an application called myFlix built using **React**, based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database)
that I have built [myflix-backend](https://github.com/paulinemarg/myFlix-backend.git). The app is hosted on Netlify.[myFlix](https://paulinemarg-myflix.netlify.app)

## Technologies

- Parcel

## Get started ðŸš€

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

parcel [path to index.html]
```

_By default path to index.html is 'src/index.html'_

```bash
parcel src/index.html   or   npm run dev
```

**Note:** If you do not have parcel installed globally, your terminal will tell you that the command 'parcel' is not found. Make sure it is installed globally.

### Run application in browser

Parcel will run a local server on port: 1234

Open the application in your browser
